    <h3>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII")</h3>
    <p>
      PII is personally identifiable information such as your full name, postal
      address, e- mail address, phone number and license details, and includes
      information about your product and/or service subscription, wallet
      information and billing records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of your
      name, address, telephone number and electronic address, is not considered
      PII.
    </p>
    <h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PII</h3>
    <p>
      You may browse through the Website without registering and without
      providing any PII. If you are qualified and decide to become a registered
      member (as defined in the Terms of Use Agreement, a "Registered Member"),
      then you will be asked to enter your contact information and business
      profile which may contain PII. We encourage you to submit relevant and
      complete information so we can provide you a more personalized experience
      on our site. In some cases, we may add or augmented information about you
      and your company via publicly available information not considered PII.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are User and send an initial contact to us using our "Contact Now"
      form- generating email or if you post a “Lead” or requirement, we will
      retain your PII and its contents for the Registered Members to access
      within their account management area and, depending on the type of contact
      or posting, we may distribute it across the Website. For instance, if a
      User selects a contact in the Registered Members to view their product and
      prices, we may add that lead to our Leads Central area so that we can
      suggest you similar leads. We will also collect and retain your contact
      information in a User database as a Registered Member to facilitate future
      access and usage of the Website. Your PII will not be resold to other
      companies and will not be shared with any third party except as provided
      in this Policy. While we do not have any current plans to use this PII, we
      reserve the right to use this PII in the future in order to communicate
      with you about Dressland Uniforms, improvements in our service, and so
      forth. In such case, you will be able to opt-out of future communications
      when you discontinue your registration with us. In addition, even if you
      do not register, we may collect PII from you in other ways, such as if you
      send us an e-mail via the “Contact Us” page of the Website and cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information containing PII may also be collected to complement information
      obtained by a business partner or by a third party. In such instance, you
      are asked to validate and/or complement your contact information and
      profile, including any PII, as the case may be, to activate your account
      on the Website as a fully registered member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the nature of the Website, as a Registered Member, you understand
      and agree that all PII entered on the Website upon registration and update
      of your account (except for payment information described in Section 3.5
      below), whether in the obligatory or optional fields provided, may be
      posted on the Website and made available to other users and to the public.
      Your PII will not be resold to other companies and will not be shared with
      any third party except as provided in this Policy.
    </p>

      When using our online payment feature to establish an account with us, you
      are providing us with further PII, such as billing information, credit or
      debit card number and expiry date and information allowing the tracking of
      checks or other payment instrument. Only parties responsible for
      processing your registration and/or orders will have access to your credit
      card and bank information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect information that may include PII, obtained through
      registration and use of our Website. Such information, which is not
      traceable to individual users as such, is used for statistical,
      analytical, monitoring and marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with most Internet sites, the Website collects certain technical data,
      including your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access
      account on the Internet), domain, and web browser information. We do not
      log the specific identity of visitors. Technical data is used only
      generally to create broad demographic summaries of the Website usage and
      activity (such as average time spent and pages viewed) to assist us in
      providing useful content that is tailored to be of most value to our
      users. For example, this information is used by our Website developer in
      order to create new features, content, and services, and aggregate - not
      individual - information about our user base is also provided to actual
      and potential partners. We may also use technical data to block or flag
      access to our service to protect the security and integrity of our
      services and Website. Also, if you access the Site from a mobile or other
      device, your unique device identifier assigned to that device or other
      transactional information for that device may also be collected. All of
      these technologies are designed to improve and personalize your experience
      using the Website. By using the Website, you consent to the use of the
      tracking technologies as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Website uses "cookies" and "pixel tags". Cookies are small text files
      transmitted by a website server to a temporary memory feature located in
      the personal computer of the website visitor. This gathering technology
      can be used to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's ongoing
      access to and use of the site, as well as to collect and archive
      information such as individual user's address and/or domain name, type of
      browser, computer operating system as well as related websites. A pixel
      tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed
      on certain pages of the Website but not on your computer. When you access
      these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. The
      information from cookies and pixel tags may generally serve to improve on
      our services but do not allow your identification. We do not record any
      PII in cookies or pixel tags, or store any information about your
      movements on the Internet outside of our Website. You can choose to
      decline cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if
      you do, some parts of our Website may not operate properly. Web logs are
      maintained by this Website. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will
      simply detect an anonymous Website visit and certain features of the
      Website may not be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dressland Uniforms employs other companies and/or individuals to perform
      functions on our behalf. For instance, we may appoint third parties to

      individuals in the course of Dressland Uniforms business operations. All
      Dressland Uniforms employees, agents and contractors who have access to
      your PII are required to protect the information in a manner that is
      consistent with this Policy.

      purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Dressland Uniforms
      Apparels or otherwise than in such connection, in exceptional

      transferred or sold has expressly committed to protect your PII and seek
      confirmation from you on any further use of the information. You also
      agree that the PII collected through registration and use of the Website
      may also be posted on another website(s) that is owned and operated by Dressland Uniform, and on any other Dressland Uniforms partner, affiliate
